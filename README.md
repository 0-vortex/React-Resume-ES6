# Jon Bloomer React Resume ES6

ES6 Version of my [React Resume site](https://github.com/freaksauce/React-Resume)

I created my updated personal site using React with ES6 to create components from the data in my JSON resume file and render each component into a single page application. The first step was to create my resume in the JSON Resume Schema format (https://jsonresume.org/), I then loaded this JSON file into the main app.js file and passed each individual section as props to the individual React components. I used Babel to compile the ES6 code to a single ES5 js bundle.

The result can be viewed online at http://jonbloomer.com.au
