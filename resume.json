    "summary": "transitioning generic lamp-designed apps to paas can prove itself troublesome when you have to take quick decisions that will impact your future. that's why I like my apps to run as fast as possible, without caring much for the technologies used to do that.\n\nI think that any sane person will follow a OOP MVC pattern but the more we turn towards objects, it's just the abstraction of a living organism - i call this the human model.\n\nrather than listing both trending and non-trending technologies I use, I'd like to point out some of the philosophical concepts that fuel my perception as a programmer:\n\n- DRY, Don't Repeat Yourself\n- KISS, Keep It Simple Stupid\n- OCCAM'S RAZOR\n- ZENO'S PARADOXES\n\nI use both practical and theoretical reason to reach my goals and never tire learning something new",
